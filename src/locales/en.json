      "description": "Your first step into the underwater world. Learn basic diving skills and theory.",
      "fullDescription": "Take a simple 4 days of your time and learn how to dive, how to get confidence and control underwater and receive a certification valid for the rest of your life, all around the globe.\n\nThe \"Open Water Course\", considered as the 1st level of PADI, is perfectly built for whoever wants to know what all the basics of scuba diving are.\n\nStep by step, you'll get to know and understand why so many of us fell in love with it and made it a career. Some theory, some preparation in the pool, just to get used to it, and a lot of time in open sea, that's what it is.\n\nDuring a minimum of 4 dives, your instructor will show you, teach you and tell you all about diving. By the time he'll be signing your certification, you'll be ready to join the big world of divers, crazy people, same as we are, travelling, working and simply waking up in the morning just to jump back in and get back to this unbelievable aquatic life.\n\nAs Open Water diver, your depth limit will be 18 meters, valid everywhere around the world and good for the rest of your life.\n\nMaterial, all included in the course, is available in multiple languages. Personal advice: if English is not your 1st language but you are still comfortable with it, get everything done in English. If you do fall in love with it…on your future dives, English will always be the one you'll find on any diving destination.\n\nThe course is not only based on theory or skills, some of your dives will be simply swimming around, looking at things and breathing underwater. Probably the best feeling…like being in space, but underwater!",

      "description": "Expand your diving skills with 5 adventure dives including deep and navigation.",
      "fullDescription": "Second level, done with the Open Water and time to get more into details, into practical stuff, into different techniques…well then it's time for the Advanced course.\n\nWithin 2 days, or more, complete 5 adventure dives and get certified. The main reason why people get to do the \"Advanced\" is to be allowed to dive up to 30 meters deep, which is a very good reason, but that's not it, the course offers also plenty of other options and advantages.\n\nThe Advanced course includes 16 different options of dives from which you will have to choose five. Considering your location, some of the options can differ from those offered in cold countries and warm countries. One thing for sure, 2 of the 5 dives are mandatory: the Deep and the Navigation dives.\n\nOn the deep dive, your instructor will be taking you to a depth of 30 meters and test you regarding the \"nitrogen narcosis\" effect on your brain. Some people get knocked; some people start acting foolish and others pretend (!!) not to feel anything. This dive will certainly be a good laugh and of course will allow you to reach such depth on any further dives.\n\nDuring the Navigation dive, you'll be learning more about underwater orientation. Using both natural reference and compass, your instructor might ask you to find back the boat for him…hum…let's see if you'll manage! There will be also some distance calculation using both fin kick and time. Same as the deep…it usually ends up in a good laugh!\n\nFor the other 3 dives, you'll have the chance to choose in between all the options. What we usually recommend our students is to take the \"Peak Performance Buoyancy\" dive, which consists in breathing skills, different fin kicks and hovering exercise. Many people also go for the \"Night Dive\", experiencing the aquatic life in dark, using a torch to light on the rabbit fish getting hypnotized and attacked by the giant Barracuda hanging around you! You'll get to choose either the \"Underwater Photography\", the \"Multi-Level and Computer diving\", the \"Fish Identification\" or the Naturalist dive.\n\nAlmost like fun diving, over a minimum of 2 days, you can get your certification and be now ready for any diving location. Being an Open Water Diver brings you the diving world, but being an Advanced diver opens all the possible doors!\n\nIf any of you plan to go diving in the Similan Islands or in Sipadan Islands for example, the \"Advanced\" level will be required for most of the dive sites. Keep this in mind and get it done!",

      "fullDescription": "The E.F.R. course is the PADI version of what many learned in school, at work or by interest.\n\nThe Primary care and secondary care in case of emergency or accident. Someone choking, unconscious, in shock, injured with serious bleeding or simply unresponsive, do you remember what to do in such situations?\n\nNot necessarily related to diving, the EFR course is a prerequisite before enrolling into the Rescue Course. If you did a similar course from a recognized association in the past year, as long as you have proof, you'll be able to start your Rescue Diver level straight away. But if not, an EFR course will be necessary.\n\nAnd you know what? Why not?! Such formation does not only have something to do with diving incidents, but can also be useful in your daily life.\n\nDo you remember or do you know what to do with someone having a heart attack, someone having a stroke or with a severe airway obstruction? What about if you have to do chest compressions, did you know that it's now 30 compressions to 2 rescue breaths for both kids and adults? What about if you find your friend with a very rapid pulse and clammy skin, do you remember what it could be?\n\nThe Emergency First Responder course will cover all that. Some of you will only need to refresh their skills and others will practice it for the 1st time, doesn't matter, as long as you realize how important this knowledge can be.\n\nOne day in the classroom with your instructor, talking, demonstrating, practicing and responding to different scenarios and here you are, certified as an Emergency First Responder.\n\nYour certification will be valid for 2 years before having to simply refresh the notions.\n\nIf you did such a course during the last year and plan to come and do your \"Rescue Course\", please bring proof or your card.",
