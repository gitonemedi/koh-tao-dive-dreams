      detailedDescription="Sail Rock is widely regarded as the Gulf of Thailand's premier scuba diving site. Located 40 minutes offshore, this impressive granite pinnacle rises from the deep blue ocean to within 18 meters of the surface. The site is famous for its 'Chimney' - a distinctive vertical swim-through that creates a natural vortex attracting large pelagic fish. Whalesharks are frequently sighted cruising the depths, and the site hosts massive schools of snapper, fusiliers, and chevron barracuda. Eagle rays and sailfish are also common visitors, making this a truly spectacular deep diving experience."
