This intermediate dive site features a stunning variety of coral formations, from colorful soft corals to massive gorgonians. The site is renowned for its healthy coral coverage and abundant marine life. Pink-tailed triggerfish, rarely seen elsewhere in Koh Tao, make this site particularly special. Ocellated eagle rays and marbled octopuses add to the biodiversity. The underwater topography includes swim-throughs, small caves, and coral-encrusted boulders that create perfect habitats for marine life."
